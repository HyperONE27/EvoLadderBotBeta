- ✅ Database consistency: Fixed schema mismatches and missing field handlers

### Database & Infrastructure
- ✅ Define PostgreSQL schema
- ✅ Full migrate to PostgreSQL
  - ✅ Hybrid architecture with SQLAlchemy adapter allows local testing with SQLite and remote host testing with PostgresSQL
- ✅ Store replays in separate persistent storage and not in SQL tables
- ✅ Optimize the shit out of PostgreSQL queries
  - ✅ Bundle queries
  - ✅ Change query types
- ✅ Implement spawning helper processes for replay parsing (multiprocessing with ProcessPoolExecutor)
  - ✅ Created parse_replay_data_blocking() worker function
  - ✅ Implemented global process pool with configurable workers
  - ✅ Updated on_message() to use run_in_executor()
  - ✅ Comprehensive test suite (6/6 tests passing)
  - ✅ Full documentation and demonstration scripts
- ✅ Implement service locator pattern for global service instances
- ✅ Migrate timestamps from TIMESTAMP to TIMESTAMPZ with explicit UTC declaration
  - ✅ Source-internal architecture continues to assume UTC

### Legacy Cleanup
- ✅ De-activate the outdated /activation command

### Matchmaking & Match Flow
- ✅ Fill out the full cross-table for 16 regions
- ✅ Get the matchmaker to correctly assign server based on the cross-table
- ✅ Add more information/clean up existing information on the match found embed
- ✅ Matchmaker now assigns matches in waves occurring every 45 seconds, up from 5, trading time for fairer matches
- ✅ Expanding MMR window for matchmaking scales dynamically with active player count and proportion of active player count 
- ✅ 99 race conditions on the wall, 99 race conditions, take one down, pass it around, 157 race conditions on the wall...
- ✅ Forbid queueing while a match is active, or queueing again while already queueing.
- ✅ Consolidated management of QueueSearchingView locks into a single class

### Match Reporting & Completion
- ✅ Make the match reporting pipeline more robust
- ✅ Fix race conditions resulting in the first player to report match result not getting any updates
- ✅ Add replay uploading and storage to the database (no automatic parsing for now)
- ✅ Fix some lag associated with both players receiving confirmation of match results
- ✅ Fix the main embed being overwritten with an error embed when players report disagreeing match results
- ✅ Add an option to abort 3 matches a month. Aborting matches causes no MMR change.
  - ✅ Exceeding this count and throwing games/smurfing will result in bans.
- ✅ Fix the display of remaining abortions to players
- ✅ Match completion on backend is properly abstracted away from frontend
- ✅ Consolidated management of MatchFoundView locks into a single class

### MMR & Ranking System
- ✅ MMR is now ELO-like rather than classic ELO spec-compliant (divisor = 500 rather than 400; 100-point gap predicts a 62-38 win chance instead of 64-36)
- ✅ MMR is now integer-based rather than float-based
- ✅ MMR curve now more closely resembles that of Brood War
- ✅ Add dynamic rank calculations (S/A/B/C/D/E/F) to leaderboard and player profiles
- ✅ Add rank filter toggling
- ✅ Edit and add rank emotes

### Replay System
- ✅ Replays are now redirected to storage instead of being stored directly in tables
- ✅ Tables now store replay paths
- ✅ Move replays to a dedicated table and add pointer logic between tables
- ✅ Parse replays for basic info: players, player races, observers, map, timestamp, length, etc.
- ✅ Send a message to the user with this information when they upload a replay
- ❌ Update the MatchFoundViewEmbed with this information
  - ✅ Send a new embed message with this information
- ✅ Check that uploaded replays comply with the match parameters
  - ✅ Throw a warning if the map link do not match exactly
  - ❌ Reject the replay outright if the wrong races are present

### System Hardening & Optimization
- ✅ No 60-second leaderboard refresh loop, invalidate cache specifically only when services modify MMR
- ✅ Remove synchronous leaderboard path (async path should not fall back to it)
- ❌ Implement a smarter prune protection algorithm than using string matching
  - ✅ Still using string matching but it's less stupid now
- ❓ Implement frontend mock testing
  - ✅ Characterization/regression tests including simulation of frontend flows but not true UI mocking

### User Interface & Commands
- ✅ Command guard: Fully decoupled command guarding errors from frontend
- ✅ Add a /profile page to view one's own MMRs and settings
- ✅ Add flag emojis to country dropdowns in /setup (including XX and ZZ custom emotes)
- ✅ Add flag emojis to /setcountry confirmation embeds
- ❌ Implement action deferral? And add loading bars + disable UI while waiting
  - ✅ Removed all action deferral, since the bot is now so fast that deferral hurts UX

### MORE RANDOM BUGS???
- ✅ Accepting ToS does not properly record having accepted (FIXED)

Hi all,

Before I go to bed tonight, I wanted to check in with everyone about the state of the ladder so far.

It's been just under 2 weeks since the alpha launch, and we have about 120 players who have played at least one game on the ladder. Those players have played a total of over 1700 games, or shy of 150 games per day.

In the grand scheme of StarCraft II, that's not much.

But the ladder alpha isn't defined by the number of people who play it — it's defined by the idea that even for all the inconveniences that a third-party StarCraft II ladder will never be able solve, people will still show up for the love of the game. People will play it because **SC: Evo Complete offers something that only the StarCraft community can build.**

The alpha phase of the ladder has been the most intense and rewarding experience I've had as a software engineer, and I'm grateful every day to be doing work that has a visible impact. Every single one of you who queued up for the ladder, reported bugs, or provided your thoughts on the feedback channels is not just simply an integral member of the community, but a co-contributor to what the ladder will become.

This project only works because real players show up and care. And you're one of them.

## What's Next

I'm going quieter on visible updates for a while. Not because development is slowing down, but because the next phase requires rebuilding the bot code from the ground up. It's the kind of work that isn't flashy — but it's essential. For that, I need to discontinue active work on the alpha. This means content and feature updates and bug fixes will be minimal.

The alpha proves that the ladder *can* exist. But the beta has to prove something more — that a third-party StarCraft II platform can be just as seamless and rewarding of an experience as anything Blizzard-official.

To do that, the foundation has to be right. The alpha codebase was built on sand, as a proof-of-concept: perfect for iteration, terrible for scale. The beta codebase will be set in bedrock: durable, resilient, and ready for anything the ladder will ever need.

## Roadmap for the Beta

Not only does the ladder code need to be rewritten, but the list of planned new features is ambitious.

The beta will serve as the testing grounds for the following:

- Full locale support for:
  - 🇺🇸 enUS
  - 🇰🇷 koKR
  - 🇨🇳 zhCN
  - 🇲🇽 esMX
  - 🇷🇺 ruRU
  - These language communities form the core of our playerbase.
- New gamemodes:
  - 2v2
  - 3v3
  - FFA
  - and other alternative gamemodes.
- Better matchmaking: more sensitive to wait times, concurrent player activity, and regional separation (especially at lower MMRs).
- Better match reporting: significantly more automation and far fewer manual reports. Match results will be processed from just one player uploading a file.
- Better sense of activity:
  - While current queue attempts in off-hours are shockingly high, most players leave quickly, missing each other by minutes.
  - The beta will feature tools to help players know when they can expect matches, without enabling sniping or dodging.
- Better analytics: expanding beyond basic Win/Loss/Draw into richer match history insights.
- Better admin tools: stronger monitoring and integrity systems to keep the ladder fair.
- And more.

The scope of this undertaking is the grandest of anything I've done before. Each new feature brings its own challenges, and the rebuild will likely take one to two months — perhaps more. But I'm doing it all with a clear goal: the beta cannot just be a hobby project. It needs to be built with all the attention and care that a serious, legitimate platform deserves.

## Thanks again for playing the ladder alpha.

In a few months, the ladder beta will be the star of the show, but it won't be alone. I can't share details yet, but there's more on the way. You won't want to miss it.

I'll see you all again soon with something worthy of a proper beta.
